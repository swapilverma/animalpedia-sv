# Animalpedia
Created with CodeSandbox


Here ,I have created a animal dictionary using ReactJS at [CodeSandboc](https://codesandbox.io/)

Using this, either searching or clicking the animals present in our database it tells us name of that animal.

This can be checked out using the following link [Animalpedia](https://cy55b.csb.app/)
